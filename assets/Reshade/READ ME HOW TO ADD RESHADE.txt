1. Copy the 3 files that have "ReShade" in them, and also include "opengl32.dll"
2. Paste the files in where the Executable is at (PNG is included)

Have fun with the reshades :)

If you think this is a virus or something that will inject to the mod it is no virus. If you want to make one yourself go to https://reshade.me/#download and you can download it and do it yourself. This is mostly used for Roblox because of "RTX' graphics.

I will not put the tutorial on how to set it up, i can however put a video here: https://youtu.be/Yflnc9AhPR8

It's best to install every addon, and make sure you select "OpenGL" when proceeding.

FNF is a 2D game, so many of the options may look weird or out of place.

RESHADE DOES UPDATE, IT IS THE SAME SETUP!

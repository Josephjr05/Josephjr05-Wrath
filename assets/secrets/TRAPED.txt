PAGE 1

Purple was glitch at first. As he found a victim, he took over the players lobby trapping all of there souls in the game "NEVER TO RUN".

He only goes to other lobbys if they are named T R A P E D. 

Which boyfriend had made one named that for fun.

As purple joined, a dark glare in his eyes, it didnt look pretty. As redcew joined the lobby, Darkblue and Orange all started the round.

It was normal at first, but Boyfriend spawned in medbey with purple. As purple started to leak blood out his Eyes. 

Darkblue was the first to be picked as his victims. The game looked very normal at first but stuff started to change as the game went on. Nobody, I MEAN, NOBODY DIED. But in the game, all the walls, everything was changing into flames and fire. 


The smoke cleared the entire sked. As Boyfriend saw Purple standing there, his skin was burning off to reveal a human eye with bodies and ink. The final showdown goes on, boyfriend got out safely but the others are under his control.

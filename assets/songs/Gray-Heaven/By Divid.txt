Song: Gray Heaven

Tempo: 220bpm

Important information: Gray Heaven does not follow the same copyright as most Camellia tracks. You should not recieve any copyright strikes, but might lose monetezation for the video if you plan on showcasing it on YouTube. This is a difficult song, but the chart that is displayed on my (Divid's) channel can most definatley be made easier. I have both produced the cover and charted it for osu!mania. If any rhythm is difficult to chart by ear, the mania chart is 100% accurate. Have fun! Please do not forget to credit both me and Camellia for any usage of this cover.

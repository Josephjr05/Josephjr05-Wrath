If you have this build, hey! 
I'm going to be explaining about the mod and stuff so if you have questions, this should help.

Q: Where do notetypes and custom_events go?
A: In mods folder. Assets doesn't work for somereason.

Q: What do i do if the mod crashes?
A: Your work isn't saved and whatever you did is on you. Make sure to put in the right actions. Always save before playing the chart.

Q: What songs have available difficulties?
A: (IN ORDER)
   ----------
Kisaragi: Normal, and Mania. (Normal is the same as Mania, just very off.)
Freshr: All difficulties.
Funk-Off: Normal, and Hard. (Normal is the same as Hard, just half way is finished. Not all of it.)
KillerToy: Normal, Hard, and Mania. (Normal and Mania are finished. I was very lazy to do Hard).
Flash-Me-Back: Hard, and Insane. (Hard is the same as Insane, just less notes and no Camellia side.)
Luin-Of-Cletchar: Normal, and Hard. (They are both the same charts.)
Mystery-Circles-Ultra: Hard, and Mania. (Hard isn't finished, Mania is finished.)
Nuclear-Star: Mania. (Will get edited in the future)
+ERABY+E CONNEC+10N: Normal, and Mania. (Normal is a old version of what was gonna be for Mania, got scrapped quick for when i found out about Osu!Mania conversion. Mania is finished, may get edited in the future.)

Phantasia: Normal. (Is finished. Good Job HPD!)
Grevious-Lady: Mania. (Is finished, will get edited in the future.)

Tutorial-Remix: Normal. (tazzah let me chart this song like last year, hopefully it was worth it)
Sendan-Life-(katagiri-Bootleg): Mania. (Hardest one!!)


Q: How do i use debugMode?
A: Here's all shortcuts and what they do:

F1: Go back 10 seconds
F2: Go forward 10 seconds
F3: endSong
F4: restartSong
-----------------------------------
-- You can use Shift to go 10000
-- Or use Ctrl key to go 1000 or 5000 seconds of a song.
-- This also means in a section is how fast or slow the camera will switch to the opponent or player. If you make it fast it looks like you have unlimited FPS!

F5: Slow down camera movement
F6: Speed up camera movement
-----------------------------------
F7: Slow Down scroll speed
F8: Speed up scroll speed
F9: Zoom out
F10: Zoom in
F11: Turn on or off Botplay
F12: Turn on or off Practice Mode

IF you have a 60% keyboard, do FN and a number.

Q: Can i make changes to charts and add onto the mod?
A: Yeah ofcourse, you're the charter.

Right?...


Information:

You can do whatever you want. There's nothing much in the mod besides the songs and many characters. If the mod crashes because of a character is chosen or something else, most likely it isn't in the mod. OR you did something wrong to an event or tried to get a character into the mod with the character editor. 

THIS MOD USES ASSETS FOR CHARTS, EVENTS, DIALOUGE, MOSTLY EVERYTHING! 
MODS FOLDER IS FOR CUSTOM_EVENTS AND NOTETYPES!

Go crazy with the charts!

Also, if you want to learn how to chart Mania, you should take inspiration from the Mania charts that's currently in the build.

ALSO, there's alot more than what's in the main game. Have fun! Look through the files :)
